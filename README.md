This is a simple Retro Snaker game.

To run it, just double click `make.bat`, use h/j/k/l or number 4/5/8/6 for moving left/down/up/right.
To pause while playing, press p, and to resume, press r;

If you do not have a g++ compiler, goto dir release and get `game.exe`

I think you can use it to help you adapt to vim operation. :-)
